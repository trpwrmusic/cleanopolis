# cleanopolis

We have build a prototype with Adobe XD (see cleanopolis_demo.mp4). 
Right now we are working on translating our vision to code.

## Tech
We are useing Python as a ***backend*** with the streamlit library for a ***frontend***.

For the image recognization we used OpenCV but this just broke the code so we took it out for now. xD


## Librarys (must install)
streamlit
⋅ folium
⋅ streamlit-folium
⋅ numpy
⋅ pandas
```python
pip install streamlit
pip install folium
pip install streamlit-folium
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
